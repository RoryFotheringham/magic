    ok, I need to write some way to read the output because z3.model.check() is messy.

[1, 13, 7, 4, 8, 5, 9, 14, 2, 3, 15]

[1: top_to_bottom, 
13: turn_top,
 7: straight_cut, 
 4: flip_2,
 8: straight_cut,
 5: flip_2,
 9: straight_cut,
14: turn_top,
 2: top_to_bottom,
 3: top_to_bottom,
15: turn_top]
